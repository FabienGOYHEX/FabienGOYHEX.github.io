                <p style="text-align: justify" class="card-text">Episode IV begins when Darth Vader's cruiser captures the ship of Princess Leia who
                    holds the stolen plans of the Black Star, the absolute weapon of the mighty Galactic Empire. The
                    princess conceals the plans in the memory of the R2-D2 droid who ejects on the planet Tatooine with
                    his alter ego C-3PO. The droids are captured by Jawas scrapers before being finally sold to the Owen
                    Lars Farm where Luke Skywalker, a young farmer who dreams of adventure, lives. The latter intercepts
                    a message from Princess Leia seeking help from a certain Obi-Wan Kenobi. The latter is an old Jedi
                    who lives as a hermit on Tatooine since the end of the Clone War4 and the advent of the Empire. He
                    reveals to Luke that he was friends with his father before he was "murdered" by Darth Vader, a
                    fallen Jedi perverted by the dark side of the Force. With the help of Obi-Wan, smuggler Han Solo and
                    his co-pilot Chewbacca, Luke manages to free Princess Leia in the corridors of the Black Star and
                    bring the stolen plans to her allies. These manage to identify the weak point of the station and
                    launch an offensive on this one. The climax of the film is reached during the Battle of Yavin which
                    results in the destruction of the Black Star and the victory of the rebel Alliance, despite many
                    losses including the death of Kenobia.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify" class="card-text">Episode V begins with a great battle, when the Empire attacks the rebellious base
                    of the planet Hoth. In the ensuing chaos, the heroes find themselves separated. Leia, Chewbacca,
                    Solo and C-3PO have indeed to face a failure of their ship and take refuge with an old friend of the
                    smuggler, Lando Calrissian, on the planet Bespin. At the same time, Luke Skywalker is training on
                    Dagobah with Jedi Master Yoda and is learning to be wary of the dark side of the Force. Vader seizes
                    his friends to try to attract Luke to him on Bespin to make a powerful ally of the Empire. Han Solo
                    finds himself trapped in a block of carbonite, then is offered to mafia Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine.
                    During a challenging duel, Darth Vader reveals to Luke that he is his father. The latter, rather
                    than surrender, chooses to throw himself into the void and is saved in extremis by his companions.

                <h2 class="card-title">Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi (1983)</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify" class="card-text">The beginning of episode VI presents the plan developed by the heroes to rescue Han
                    Solo from the hands of Jabba the Hutt. It turns out to be a success and also results in the death of
                    the Hutt. At the same time, the Empire is developing a second combat station, the Death Star, whose
                    construction is overseen by Emperor Palpatine himself. The rebel Alliance sees this as an
                    opportunity to strike a decisive blow for victory, especially as the station seems vulnerable. In
                    reality, this weakness is only feigned and it is a trap designed to eliminate the rebels
                    permanently. However, the intervention of the small Ewok people on Endor can turn the situation
                    around. In the Emperor's quarters, Luke tries to get his father, Darth Vader aka Anakin Skywalker,
                    back on the right side. While Palpatine prepares to finish his son, Vader throws his master in the
                    well of the station, not without having been severely bruised by the latter. He dies peacefully in
                    Luke's arms as the rebels destroy the Death Star. While celebrating the end of the Empire in the
                    galaxy, the spirits of Anakin, Obi-Wan and Yoda meet for one last time before merging into Forcea 7.
